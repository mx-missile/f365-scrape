However, like most of you, I\u2019ve found myself with a bit more time on my hands this past week and I have decided to ignore all the useful stuff I could be doing (and which my wife has asked me to do), and instead I\u2019m typing out this bee story for a bunch of strangers on the internet (which nobody has asked me to do). <br/><br/>Disclaimer at this stage: this is a long story and I am going to take my time telling it. There is a fair bit of background required before we even get to the bees. I was tempted not to bother explaining the background, but it\u2019ll probably save a lengthy Q&amp;A in the long run. And it\u2019s not like many of you have much else to be doing so maybe it will provide a welcome distraction. So if you don\u2019t like long reads, now is the time to fuck off.<br/><br/>I\u2019ll update the story in various stages (I\u2019m currently writing Part 6 and I reckon it\u2019s at least an 8 parter) over the next couple of days. And although I do have some photos which I will post, I don\u2019t have as many as I would like from \u201cbefore\u201d (or \u201cbee-fore\u201d if you will, hahaha) so I have prepared a couple of MS Paint diagrams as well."}, {"username": "Snapper", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 10:47", "content": "<strong>Part 1 \u2013 I remember that summer in Dublin\u2026</strong><br/><br/>In the long, hot summer of 2018, my wife and I sold our house in the leafy suburbs of South County Dublin. <br/><br/>We\u2019d been talking about getting out of Dublin for a while, in search of a quieter life, but nothing was ever firmed up until my wife was offered a job in Cork. It was a good opportunity for her, so I told her to go for it. I spoke with my own work and they were desperate to keep me, so much so that they agreed to let me to stay on in my current role and work remotely 95% of the time. We put our house on the market and it sold within a few weeks, due to the latest Dublin housing market bubble. Hurray for greed! <br/><br/>And so it was in September 2018, that we packed up our entire lives into a mover\u2019s truck and a rented Opel Vivaro, said goodbye to the house that had been our home for nearly a decade, and set off for Cork with our zero children and three dogs.<br/><br/>We first moved into a rented house, but we knew we needed to buy somewhere quickly. The rental was from a friend - it was her deceased brother\u2019s house and being sold as soon as it went through probate. With 3 large dogs we were going to struggle to find another rented place that would take us. <br/><br/>So the plan was to buy somewhere, and we had been looking for the right place all summer. It was like an episode of Escape to the Country as we traipsed around rural Cork looking for the right place\u2026 well, it was like an episode of Escape to the Country where the searching couple aren\u2019t a pair of old fuckers who you just know voted Leave.<br/><br/>Anyway, after a lengthy and at times frustrating search, we finally found the home of our dreams. We decided to buy an old mill. My wife fell in love with the gentle sound of the stream running beside it, and I fell in love with the idea of being able to leave social situations urgently simply by saying I needed to go as there was \u201ctrouble down the old mill\u201d. <br/><br/>The purchase was agreed before we left Dublin, so we hoped to be renting for no more than a few weeks. But buying a mill ain\u2019t easy, as the old saying goes. We had to do lots of surveys, speak to lots of people and make some solicitors very wealthy indeed."}, {"username": "CorneliusTBadger", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 10:48", "content": "Fuck 'em"}, {"username": "Ninjacuts", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 10:48", "content": "<img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://media3.giphy.com/media/fLDmnw9BGABGw/giphy.gif\"/>"}, {"username": "Geoff", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 10:50", "content": "'trouble at t'mill\" if you please<br/><br/>in"}, {"username": "Geoff", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 10:51", "content": "Also can I see pics of this mill.

In terms of a project, this meant that the heavy lifting in terms of knocking down walls, rewiring, plumbing etc had been taken care of relatively recently. At the same time, as most of that renovation work was done 20 years ago, it would still need a fair bit of work to modernise things and put our stamp on it.<br/><br/>Given that we didn\u2019t have an awful lot of money left after the purchase and the moving costs, we drew up a long list of stuff that we would like to do with the place. We then estimated a price for each item and then prioritised in terms of what we felt was vital and what could wait. We ended up with an \u201curgent\u201d list comprised of assorted electrical jobs around the house (eg replacing old sockets/light fittings, and installation of a new smoke alarm system), installation of a new floor and built-in wardrobes in the master bedroom as both were in poor nick, and refitting the en-suite bathroom completely, as it was in very poor nick. <br/><br/>The idea was that by getting this work done, we would have reassurance us that the electrical and fire safety systems were up to scratch throughout the house, and we would also bring the master bedroom and en-suite up to a good standard of finish/decor. The kitchen and living room were in good condition already, so we would then have the basics covered in terms of day-to-day living and could set about bringing the other rooms (spare bedrooms, dining room, main bathroom) up to the same standard over time.<br/><br/>Our purchase also included a small cottage on the property which was modernised about 5 years ago. This meant that we had the luxury of being able to move into the cottage while the different tradesmen worked on the mill. This was a godsend to be honest - anyone who has lived in a house where tradesmen are working will know how annoying and disruptive it can be.<br/><br/>In December 2018 after 3 months in the rented house, we finally took possession of the keys for the mill and the cottage\u2026 The timing meant that we got the keys the week before Christmas. With the Christmas break, nothing progressed with the work on the mill until early January and, as can often happen when there is no firm deadline in place, the work dragged on longer than it probably should have.<br/><br/>Things kept moving along at this leisurely pace until mid-February 2019, when a friend of ours suddenly found himself in need of a place to live for a few months. We offered him the cottage, thus lighting a fire under our arses in terms of urgency. We began to crack the whip a bit more with the various tradesmen, having agreed with our friend that he could have the cottage from mid-March 2019.<br/><br/>This is relevant partly because it explains why we owned the mill for 3 months before we spent any significant time in there. We were in and out to check on things, take measurements, meet tradesmen etc\u2026 but never for much more than half an hour at a time, and never in any one room for more than a few minutes. <br/><br/>In hindsight, I suppose I did notice that there were sometimes a few dead bees around the windows in the master bedroom, probably more than you would expect... but I didn\u2019t think too much about it with everything else that was going on. Fuck em, I thought to myself, they\u2019re only bees."}, {"username": "Satisfied Fool", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 11:11", "content": "The bees have arrived."}, {"username": "Snapper", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 11:12", "content": "<strong>Part 3 \u2013 Beads??? </strong><br/><br/>The next thing to point out is that a 19th century mill would obviously not have been originally built with any central heating, indoor plumbing or electrics in mind. The external walls are approximately 3 foot thick and constructed from solid masonry using whatever stones were to hand at the time\u2026 so when the previous owners set about retro-fitting these systems, they decided not to attempt to recess pipes and electrical cabling etc into the existing external walls. <br/><br/>Instead, in some rooms they installed plasterboard surrounds running along the wall, and come to just under window level. At the bottom of these surrounds, they boxed in electrical cables for wall sockets and plumbing pipes for central heating and bathroom supply and waste. Above this, they had installed the radiators with appropriate space allowed so that the rads are exposed.<br/><br/>I am conscious that I am probably explaining this terribly so have prepared some MS paint diagrams of the setup in the master bedroom which will hopefully make it clear.<br/><br/>This was the basic set-up as you looked at it:<br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZMTYb8p.jpg\"/><br/><br/>And this is how it would look as a cross-section:<br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cnJxUrl.jpg\"/><br/><br/>As you can hopefully see, the radiators were exposed and although the surround was built around them, there was a gap around the rads where you could, if inclined, reach a hand in and touch the inside of the external wall behind them, which had been finished with plasterwork. <br/><br/>In early March 2019 we had our electrician come to spend a couple of days taking care of the electrical jobs. We\u2019d already had the floorers, the bathroom guys and the wardrobe installers come and go, working almost exclusively in the master bedroom, and none had expressed any concerns about bees. But when the electrician went to replace one of the plug sockets in the master bedroom, in his words \u201ca load of fucking bees\u201d came out of the void between the surround and the external wall as soon as he removed the old socket.<br/><br/>Now I am conscious that the words \u201ca load of fucking bees\u201d means different things to different people, so I pressed him further. It turns out that there were around 15 or 20. He said that they began crawling out \u2013 not flying \u2013 and that they were sluggish and slow moving. He had he let them all come out and fall to the floor. A diligent and dedicated worker, he had simply brushed them to one side and finished his work. He only told me about it when he was finishing up that evening. So I went to have a look and found that they most of them had since managed to crawl up the wall and onto the windowsill, where some had sadly perished and others were gamely clinging on to life, but were clearly not long for this world.<br/><br/>Now this development disturbed me somewhat \u2013 it seemed obvious that there was some sort of bee community - a hive if you will - hidden somewhere in the wall. I'm pretty sharp, you see. So I got onto Google to see what I could find out\u2026 and discovered that my options were rather limited. <br/><br/>I once had a wasp\u2019s nest in the attic of my old house and an exterminator came and promptly laid the smack down on those yellow bastards with some chemicals. But bees are a different story. In Ireland (and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s probably the same for the UK) they\u2019re protected so you\u2019re not supposed to kill them if you find a hive. Instead you should contact the Irish Beekeeper\u2019s Association who will put you in touch with a local beekeeper who will come out and remove the hive. <br/><br/>Fair enough, the little bastards give us honey and pollinate plants and so forth, so I guess they deserve some protection."}, {"username": "Snapper", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 11:15", "content": "That's all for today, hopefully there's enough to keep you cretins satisfied for now.<br/><br/>I'll do parts 4 to 6 tomorrow and probably finish things off on Wednesday, although as I said, I am still writing this and it will BEE as long as it needs to BEE.  <img alt=\":smug:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smug.gif\" title=\"Smug\"/> <br/><br/>I'll try get around to posting some general photos of the house for you Geoff, and yes I am aware of all of the bee jokes and have relied upon most of them in the course of my story.<br/><br/> <img alt=\":toppa:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/5.gif\" title=\"Toppa\"/>"}, {"username": "cooks-looking", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 11:17", "content": "He's been playing you the bee side!"}, {"username": "Smith 9", "date": "30 Mar 2020, 11:21", "content": "<blockquote><div><cite>Snapper wrote:</cite>I once had a wasp\u2019s nest in the attic of my old house and an exterminator came and promptly laid the smack down on those yellow bastards with some chemicals.</div></blockquote><br/><br/> <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" title=\"lol\"/> <br/><br/>I actually have the pleasure of bumble bees in my house every year, guess they must nest in the attic somewhere.

When the previous owners renovated, they knocked through to connect the mill and cottage internally by way of a single storey extension with a flat roof (beside where my car is parked).<br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KWXprwi.jpg\"/><br/><br/>This is the other side of the house, which is the front door into the place. <br/><br/>It's a confusing layout but you get used to it  <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" title=\"lol\"/> <br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rnthWH9.jpg\"/><br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9FKkkhs.jpg\"/><br/><br/>Some photos of the stream.<br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wMOaYA8.jpg\"/><br/><br/>Finally, this is a photo I just found which was taken the night we got the keys for the house.

I phoned and spoke with a man who sounded somewhat interested in my plight, and he told me he\u2019d call me back to arrange when he could come take a look later in the week.<br/><br/>The next evening, I got changed into a football shirt, shorts and astros to head to my regular 7-a-side game. Just as I stepped outside the front door, a car pulled into our driveway. It transpired this was the beekeeper. So much for phoning in advance to arrange.<br/><br/>It was a cold, wet night and already dark when he arrived. I was feeling like a total full kit wanker as we walked into the mill. The house was still empty at this point, so the heating was off. I was fucking frozen in my shorts to be honest and was hoping his visit would be quick so I could still make it to football. We headed up to the master bedroom so he could take a look around. <br/><br/>I showed him the bees on the windowsill. All the little lads were dead by this stage. He picked up one of them held it up to his face. \u201cYeah, this looks like one of mine\u201d, he said - more to himself than to me. I asked how he could tell, but he didn\u2019t answer. Instead he dropped to his hands and knees and put his ear to the wall, near to the socket where the electrician had been working. He stayed there for an uncomfortably long time. At one point I started to say something, just to break the awkward silence. \u201cShhhhh\u201d, he hissed at me without looking, so I shut up.<br/><br/>Eventually, he clambered to his feet and said that if there was a bee-hive somewhere in our wall, then it couldn\u2019t be a very big one. Cheers pal, I thought, that\u2019s put me in my place. I didn\u2019t say that though, instead I asked him why he thought that. He looked at me like I was an idiot and said \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t hear any buzzing\u201d. Scientific stuff - so far, so very reassuring. <br/><br/>He did get a bit more in-depth with his bee expertise to be fair to him. He explained that if there was a working colony in our wall, it had probably been established by some stray bees from a nearby hive \u2013 most likely one of his hives, as he was the beekeeper living closest to me. But he thought this was unlikely, as he wasn\u2019t missing a queen, which every working colony needs. This meant that it was more likely that the bees in our wall were some of his lads out scavenging resources from an old hive that had died. <br/><br/>Then he said that even if we did have a working hive, there is a certain kind of mite present in pretty much all beehives, which if left untreated kills bees (this is basically why bee numbers are declining). Beekeepers spray their hives regularly to kill this mite, but hives in the wild are basically doomed. A very large hive may have the numbers to withstand the mites, but he didn\u2019t believe the hive in our wall was nearly large enough to survive. He told me that this mite-related genocide usually occurs in March as the colony begins wakes up from the cold winter. By mid-April, he reckoned, the entire hive would be dead. It was a grim outlook to be honest, but one that suited my selfish agenda.<br/><br/>I told him that we were planning to move into the master bedroom in a week or so, and asked if there was any reason that we shouldn\u2019t do this. He said that he thought it would be perfectly fine, but if we had any issues we could give him a call and he\u2019d come out again to re-evaluate.<br/><br/>In any case, he promised to come back during daylight and take a look at some of the external walls from outside, to see if he could determine where exactly the bees were getting in and out of the hive, as this would need to be blocked up to prevent another hive setting up at a later stage.<br/><br/>Content with this, I headed off to football.

My wife was in the US for work, so I found myself spending the long weekend alone, moving our possessions from the cottage to the mill. I also decided to paint the newly fitted en-suite bathroom. Great craic altogether, St Patrick would have been proud. Anyway, I got everything moved over and gave the keys for the cottage to our friend so he could move in there. I stuck the heating on full blast in the mill to get some heat into the place \u2013 it hadn\u2019t been on very much when nobody was living there \u2013 and got cracking with putting stuff away and painting.<br/><br/>Before too long, the buzzing began. I was in the bathroom painting and I had Alexa for company. Between lulls in our witty back and forth (\u201cAlexa, how do I get rid of this erection?\u201d\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know that one\u201d), I gradually realised that a constant background noise had developed. Bzzzz. <br/><br/>I went to investigate. It was coming from the section of the surround above the notorious socket. It wasn\u2019t particularly loud \u2013 it sounded like just a few bees buzzing around in the wall. I pushed on with painting, ignoring the noise in the way that only a man can when he is hoping a problem will resolve itself without him having to do any work.<br/><br/>I finished painting the en-suite and then put the master bedroom to rights, carefully putting my clothes away in my side of the new built-in wardrobe, and throwing my wife\u2019s clothes into an untidy pile in her side. The room was looking pretty good so I went downstairs and did some similar unpacking in the kitchen and the living room. That night, I slept the sleep of a man who was tired from painting and unpacking. I didn\u2019t hear any more buzzing.<br/><br/>A few days later, my wife got back from her work trip and I decided to visit my office in Dublin. I had agreed with my boss that I would show face for a couple of days every month just to remind people that I existed, so I booked myself into a hotel and headed up the motorway. That night, I phoned my wife from the hotel and she told me that she was going to sleep in the spare room because she could hear buzzing in the master bedroom, and that a few more dead bees had appeared on the floor. <br/><br/>When I got back the following night, I found that a slow but steady stream of bees had begun to find their way out from inside the walls. They were still lethargic but were more alert than before. Some of them could even fly for a few feet before dropping to the floor with a light thud. It was clear that the hive had begun to awaken \u2013 due either to the warmer spring weather or to the warmer house, given that the radiators were now on more frequently than before. <br/><br/>Over the next few days, the buzzing behind the wall became louder and louder, and was now nearly constant during daylight hours. More and more bees started finding their way out from behind the radiator. And for every bee that made it out of the wall, it sounded like there were hundreds still in there.<br/><br/>I went outside to see if this increased bee activity had an obvious entry point. I located a section of pointing in the mortar that had some visible cracks in it. I watched for a while and could see bees coming and going. I had found their access point into the house. <br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xHEannV.jpg\"/><br/><br/>Circled in blue are the bedroom windows, in green is where the bee traffic was most concentrated. It made sense that they were showing up inside where they were, I reckoned the socket would be smack bang in the middle of the green circle.<br/><br/>So the mortar would need to be re-pointed to close up any gaps, but it was work that would need to be done at height. It was far too risky an undertaking with the bees coming and going. We would need to wait for the hive to die first, then take care of the re-pointing. <br/><br/>In the meantime, I had to take some action. I found some old bed sheets and cut them up, then used packing tape to tightly secure the sheets to the radiator surround, thus (I hoped) imprisoning the bees in the wall and at least preventing them from coming into the bedroom. My plan was no more than one of containment. I hoped to temporarily create a liveable situation where we could we wait for the mites to take care of their nasty business."}, {"username": "Geoff", "date": "31 Mar 2020, 08:03", "content": "bees"}, {"username": "elrobertos", "date": "31 Mar 2020, 08:04", "content": "Really enjoying this.

My wife decided that she was OK with sleeping in the master bedroom, at least as long as I was in the house (makes a change lol). Her side of the bed was furthest from the hive so I suppose she figured I\u2019d get Wicker-manned first, should there be a breach. It also helped that at night the buzzing would go quiet as all the little bees tucked themselves into bed, so it didn\u2019t really disturb us too much at first.<br/><br/>The situation went on like that for a couple of weeks but instead of getting better, it gradually got worse. As March became April, daylight became longer and the weather became warmer. The bees behind the wall would start their buzzing as soon as dawn broke and would continue that way until darkness fell, when it would finally fade into silence. The noise level of their activities increased as I guess more and more bees were coming out of slumber. <br/><br/>One day, the bees that had managed to find their way out of the wall and into the gaps around the left-side radiator began to find their way through to the gap around the radiator on the right. I still don\u2019t know how they did this \u2013 there didn\u2019t seem to be any way through that wasn\u2019t sealed off with expanding foam. I suppose with enough bees buzzing around in such a tight space, it was inevitable that they would find a way. I was forced to implement another bed-sheet solution on the second radiator. <br/><br/>This is a photo of the finished job\u2026 Pretty neat, I\u2019m sure you will agree.  <img alt=\":smug:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smug.gif\" title=\"Smug\"/> <br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kib2GIR.jpg\"/><br/><br/>At this point though, the day-to-day situation was becoming unbearable. Although the bees quietened after dark, if we turned on the lights in the bedroom it would wake them up, and you\u2019d hear the buzzing slowly begin. If we left the lights on for more than a minute or so, we\u2019d begin to see little indentations appear in the bedsheets, as bees began to thrust themselves against the fabric, looking for the source of the light. Each thrust was accompanied by a faint but incredibly disconcerting pop. These fuckers were clearly hoping to find a weakspot in my fortifications. <br/><br/>Alarmingly, the bedsheets began to become stained with little brown dots. This puzzled me at first, until I realised that tiny particles of beeswax were being transferred from their bodies to the bedsheets with every failed attempt to break through the fabric.<br/><br/>Also \u2013 and I know it's hypocritical to complain about this, given that I was the cause of their death \u2013 the dead bees had begun to pile up inside the sheets and quite frankly they had started to smell. It wasn\u2019t an awful smell but it was far from pleasant, and it was getting stronger. The number of wax-marks on the bedsheets began to increase and this started to stink too. <br/><br/>All in all, the bedroom was becoming a rather unpleasant place to be (for me at least, my wife would probably argue it\u2019s always been an unpleasant place for her). When I couldn\u2019t suffer the smell any longer, or stand to look at the stained sheets, I decided to remove them, clean out the bee graveyard as best I could and put up some fresh ones. Think about that the next time you\u2019re complaining about having to change your bedsheets and thank your lucky stars. This is a photo of what the scene was like behind the sheet during one such operation. <br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0p7uARA.jpg\"/><br/><br/>This was the right-side radiator. There were far more dead bodies in the left-side one, to the extent that there was a significant bulge developing at the bottom of the sheet where the bodies had gathered. But there were also a lot more live bees in the left-side one, so I wasn\u2019t stopping to take a photo when I changed those sheets. I had to repeat the sheet-changing every week or so to keep the situation somewhat tolerable.<br/><br/>By the middle of April 2019, with an increasingly stressful sleep situation and an increasingly unhappy wife, I decided that enough was enough. I had lost faith in the mites \u2013 they clearly weren\u2019t up to the task of killing the hive. Seriously guys, you had one job ffs.<br/><br/>I phoned the beekeeper to see if he would come back out and re-evaluate the situation as he said he would. No answer. I left a few voicemails, sent a few texts. No answer. I slid some DMs into his Twitter (@thatstupidbeekeeper). No answer. <br/><br/>At this point I got back onto the Beekeeper\u2019s Association. They told me they would reach out to him. I waited a few days. I heard nothing. I called them back. They\u2019d heard nothing. I asked them for the name and number of another beekeeper who could help. They refused to give me these details as in their eyes, the first guy now had dibs on my bees. What?? Is that a thing?? I tried to reason with them, hoping they would relent but they were steadfast. Unless I heard back from beekeeper, which seemed unlikely, I was on my own.<br/><br/>The situation was becoming ever more dire, and I\u2019d been abandoned by the one organisation I thought I could trust when it came to bees. Without the might of Beekeeper\u2019s Association behind me, I was a desperate man, all out of options and running out of time.

I didn\u2019t know where to turn. Sure, we\u2019ve all <em>heard </em>of the kind of beekeepers who\u2019ll take your bees from you no questions asked, but how does a law-abiding man go about finding one? The dark web? Did I need to download the Ice Dragon browser for that? Did I risk getting my fingers burned? This was all too much for me. I started to cry. My wife suggested trying Facebook. I started to laugh. I laughed at her until she left the room in anger. Then I thought about what she\u2019d said. I went onto Facebook.<br/><br/>I needed to cover my tracks, so the first thing I did was set up a fake Facebook profile. I used a name I had been using as an alias for a while, taken from a sushi menu I\u2019d seen in Tokyo. Once that was done, I signed Jack Mackerel up to a few local notice boards and posted about the problem. Amongst the many hilarious but not particularly helpful replies - \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t cost too much to fix, as I\u2019ve heard of people getting STUNG\u201d, \u201cLots of BUZZ about this kind of thing at the moment\u201d, \u201cStupid bee wanker\u201d (that last one was posted by me from my actual FB profile  <img alt=\":smug:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_smug.gif\" title=\"Smug\"/> ) - there was one promising post from a guy named Mark. <br/><br/>Mark said that he was a rookie young beekeeper, just starting out in the game, and keen to get his beekeeping mitts on my bees before anyone else did. Show me the honey, his hungry tone seemed to say. He sent me his phone number in a private message. I rooted out a burner phone, drove to a remote spot to prevent the feds from triangulating my location, and gave him a call. <br/><br/>He explained that he had recently started beekeeping as a hobby, and that he was looking to get more bees to grow his hive. I told him he was more than welcome to my bees, as I really wasn\u2019t using them, but that it was a collection-only situation. He seemed very eager and said he\u2019d come over straight away to take a look. I\u2019d had weeks of nothing happening so this sudden change of pace was welcome. I told him I\u2019d meet him there, gave him my address and drove home.<br/><br/>When I got back to the house, I pulled into the driveway only to find two weedy, pale-skinned urchins loitering on my property. \u201cClear out of here you little bastards!\u201d I roared at them, \u201cI\u2019ve got a beekeeper coming over!\u201d<br/><br/> \u201cB-buh-but\u2026 I\u2019m M-Mark\u201d one of them stammered, \u201cI\u2019m the beekeeper!\u201d<br/><br/>I must admit was shocked. These lads genuinely looked around 12 years of age. Could I really entrust this job to a couple of children? I thought about it. Fuck it. Kids make pretty much all my clothing, so why not let them do this too? And it\u2019s not like there were a load of adults queuing up to help.<br/><br/>Well, it turned out that Mark was actually 18 and was just about to finish school, and the other guy was his (older!) brother, who was actually 20(!!) and in his second year of university(!!!). They really did look a lot younger than they were. Or maybe thinking a beekeeper looks young is just a sign of getting old, like with policemen.<br/><br/>They went upstairs and had a quick look around the bedroom. It was still daylight and there was a lot more bee activity than when the other beekeeper had come over. It was clear from the excitement in their voices as they spoke to each other that they saw this as a potential big score. <br/><br/>I asked how many bees they had already. \u201cAround ten thousand\u201d. And how many did they think were in my walls? \u201cWe won\u2019t know for sure until we\u2019re taking them out, but maybe the same again\u201d. I thought about this and quickly realised I didn\u2019t know what to do with this information. Ten thousand bees. It sounded like a lot. Was it a lot? Who knows? Who cares? <br/><br/>I asked what approach they planned to take. They said they would come back the following evening with their beekeeping suits. They'd need to bring a smoker to subdue the bees. I said I\u2019d love to help, but I\u2019d recently given up. They chuckled politely. It was a poor gag in truth, I realise that now. I'm one of those people who thinks they are funnier and more interesting than they actually are. I'm that to a fault really... Sorry lynbod.<br/><br/>They would also bring a frame full of removable wooden trays to transfer the bees into. They would then lock this up and take it away to their beehive where they would rehome the bees. They said they would need to take some of the surround away from the wall for access, but insisted they would do their best to replace it afterwards. I said fine, no problem. <br/><br/>Now, I know there are a whole load of questions I should have asked at this point. I'm sure you're asking them yourselves. But I didn't ask any further questions. They honestly gave me no indication that the process was going to be particularly taxing or messy. That may seem foolish to you (in hindsight it definitely seems foolish to me).

Nearly a year later, I can pinpoint the exact date: Wednesday 24th April 2019. How can I be so certain, you ask? The answer is because it was the day of the Manchester derby. United vs City at Old Trafford. City needed to win to go 1 point clear of Liverpool at the top of the league. As a City supporter, it was a big day for me. Oh yeah and it was memorable also because of the bees. <br/><br/>I was nervous all day. I hate derbies anyway, they make me feel sick to my stomach, but the stakes were s high as they had been for any derby game in my lifetime. I\u2019m a simple fellow and hate when I have to be nervous about more than one thing at a time, so the bee situation was really pissing me off. I wished I\u2019d put them off until the following evening but I couldn\u2019t really justify this delaying things for a football match, no matter how important.<br/><br/>Mark and his brother arrived at around 6pm in a new Ford Ranger \u2013 it was strange to see what appeared to be a young boy driving such a large vehicle. I also remember thinking to myself that they were arriving at just about the same time that the City squad were arriving at Old Trafford. Heroes one and all, brave gladiators entering a hostile arena. I began to hope that the beekeepers might even be finished and gone before kick-off, as if they were collecting some old furniture. Oh what a fool I was.<br/><br/>I went outside to meet them as they were unpacking their stuff from the flatbed of their truck. They brought the smoker, the hive-frame and some tools upstairs, then came back outside and changed into their beekeeper suits. They paused a moment, nodded to each other once in steely resolve, and walked back into the house. I can still remember them \u2013 a vision in their bright-white outfits, netted beekeeping hats tucked under one arm. They were like a couple of little white supremacist firemen.<br/><br/>I went upstairs with them to see if they needed anything before they started. They said they didn\u2019t. They were all set. Good to go. I told them I\u2019d be downstairs watching the match if they needed me. \u201cWhat match?\u201d Mark asked. Fucking kids today  <img alt=\":roll:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif\" title=\"Roll eyes\"/> <br/><br/>I settled down to watch the pre-game build-up. I was a nervous wreck anyway, but this really wasn\u2019t helped by the banging noises which began to emanate from upstairs. I tried to ignore them as best I could. They became louder still. I put my fingers in my ears but it did no good. I could still hear them and it was unsettling, every bang made my heart jump in my chest. Then there was one incredibly loud bang. The walls shook. Birds were startled from the trees outside. I waited. Silence. I waited a bit longer. Nothing. I crept back upstairs. I inched the bedroom door open. I listened. Nothing. I began to poke my head inside. \u201cEverything OK?\u201d I started to ask. \u201cFine, fine, everything\u2019s fine!\u201d they shrieked. \u201cJust don\u2019t come in, it\u2019s not safe!\u201d That\u2019s all I needed to hear. You don\u2019t need to tell me twice to stay out of an unsafe room with bees in it. I slammed the door and hot-tailed it back down the stairs. <br/><br/>An hour or so later and I hadn\u2019t seen or heard from them since. A goalless first half hadn\u2019t helped my nerves. My palms were sweating. I felt like throwing up. The second half started. Ten minutes or so into the half, a buzzing (lol) Bernardo Silva picked up the ball on the right hand side. He cut inside onto his left and hit a shot that beat De Gea at his near post. I let out a roar of delight and danced around the room. Moments later, Mark poked his head in the room. \u201cEverything OK?\u201d he asked. I reassured him that everything was fine. Brilliant in fact. <br/><br/>I could see that the poor lad was sweating buckets in his suit, it poured down his face. I told him to go get his brother - they clearly needed to take a break. As they guzzled down water, I asked how things were going. They told me that it was going OK - they\u2019d had some trouble getting access to the hive (hence the banging) but they were in there now and were busy smoking the bees into a stupor. Once that was done, they would transfer the bees into the trays, lock them into the frame and be on their way. I had a few more questions, but just then, Leroy Sane doubled City\u2019s lead with a stinging (lol) shot that crept under De Gea, and for a few glorious seconds I forgot all about bees."}, {"username": "JStand23", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 03:46", "content": "<blockquote><div><cite>Edmund wrote:</cite>Beekeepers rape and murder his wife.

The two lads trudged back upstairs and got back down to it. City saw out the game for a precious 3 points. I sat on the couch, happy with the victory, but conscious that there were still two rookie young beekeepers toiling away in the master bedroom. That knowledge made it hard to fully relax and enjoy the moment.<br/><br/>Finally, at around 11pm, they emerged from the bedroom and trundled downstairs. As they packed the hive-frame into the truck, they told me that they had removed most of the bees, but would need to return the next day to finish up as there were still \u201ca few\u201d bees up there.<br/><br/>I asked whether the room was off-limits. I\u2019m not sure what kind of state I thought it would be in but I still harboured faint hopes for a clean bee removal. They exchanged a furtive glance. \u201cYeah, probably best to stay out of there tonight\u2026 and keep the door closed\u201d. Although this didn\u2019t fill me with confidence, it was late and I thought it best to let the poor fuckers go get some sleep and come back refreshed the next day. We could sleep in the spare room for one night, it wouldn\u2019t kill us.<br/><br/>As soon as they left, my wife emerged from wherever she had been hiding to see what the story was. I explained the situation and her brow furrowed. \u201cBut I need to pack my suitcase\u201d she said. Shit. She was right. She had to catch a flight first thing the next morning, she was going to Prague for work. Her suitcase and all of her clothes were in the master bedroom. I suggested calling the Beekeeping Bros to come back and fetch some items for her, but she wasn\u2019t comfortable with that, which was fair enough really. In a rare show of bravery, I told her to make a list of what she needed and I would go in there and get it. \u201cI mean, how bad can it BEE in there?\u201d I quipped nervously.<br/><br/>As she set about drawing up her list, I set about fashioning myself a home-made beekeeping outfit. I figured the premise is a simple one \u2013 you just have minimise exposed skin, right? I rooted out a beanie hat, some gloves, a hoodie. I tucked everything into everything - trousers into socks, hoodie sleeves into gloves, my penis into my clenched upper thighs (why take any chances). I put the beanie on my head, wrapped a scarf over my mouth and pulled the drawstrings on the hood tight. My eyes and nose were still exposed but this was the best I could do. It\u2019s not like they are important parts of the human anatomy anyway. Humans can survive with just 3 senses. I grabbed the list and headed up the stairs in trepidation.<br/><br/>I\u2019ve prepared another MS Paint picture, this time a map of the bedroom: <br/><br/><img alt=\"Image\" class=\"postimage\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZN2QF0P.jpg\"/><br/><br/>I quickly ran through a strategy in my head.

Firstly, Mike Tyson famously said that \u201ceverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d In other words, plans \u201cgang aft agley\u201d. Not my words, Michael, the words of Robert Burns.<br/><br/>The second thing I am thinking about is numbers. I have always liked numbers. They\u2019re both definite and yet curiously flexible. Numbers can overwhelm us - for example, how the rising numbers of deaths in a virus outbreak quickly lose meaning, as we struggle to comprehend the scale of human tragedy. They can also underwhelm - for example, the length of a man\u2019s penis in comparison to those of his peers. It fascinates me how the same number can seem huge or tiny depending on context.<br/><br/>You might remember how at the beginning of this saga, I told you how the electrician had said that there were \u201ca load of fucking bees\u201d in the bedroom, and how this was his description for what was, at most, a couple of dozen bees. It may not surprise you that when Mark told me that there were a still \u201ca few\u201d bees left in my bedroom, he was using a different scale of measurement entirely.<br/><br/>I reached into the room with one gloved hand and flicked the lights on. I stepped into the room. Even with the beanie hat on and the hood pulled tight, the noise was incredible. The sound of thousands of tiny wings beating hummed and throbbed through the night. <br/><br/>Although my field of vision was reduced by the tight hood, I could see that there were a lot of fucking bees in the room. A lot of fucking bees. Certainly more than what anyone could reasonably describe as \u201ca few\u201d. A thick brown buzzing haze hung in the far corner. And you know what? My  fucking map was wrong! Although numbers were more concentrated in the corner, they weren\u2019t staying in one place. They were everywhere. A bee be here, and a bee be there, here a bee, there a bee, everywhere a bee be. They were on the walls. They were on the ceiling. They were on the floor. They were \u2013 shit! They were on me! I had bees on me! <br/><br/>I realised that I was close to losing it, so I tried to focus on the plan. \u201cShimmy\u201d I said to myself. \u201cJust shimmy and it will all be OK\u201d. This helped clear my mind a little bit, and I closed the door behind me. I inched left to the wardrobe and opened it. I retrieved the suitcase, silently thanking my wife for her clear instructions on where everything was. <br/><br/>I turned to put the suitcase on the bed in order to pack it, but the sight of the bed stopped me in my tracks. My bed belonged to the bees now. I would have to hold the suitcase in one hand and throw stuff into it with the other.<br/><br/>I ran through the list of clothing as quickly as I could, taking care not to forget anything. There was no way I would be able to do this a second time. The task of packing helped to take my mind off the bees for a little while. It helped that I had my back to the room. The noise was still there, a constant thrum, but there weren\u2019t many bees in view. I\u2019m not saying I forgot that they were there entirely, but I was able to get through the list item by item.<br/><br/>Eventually, I got everything into the suitcase and slid the wardrobe door closed. The next thing to do was shimmy to the en-suite to get some toiletries. As I turned from the wardrobe, I remember a sudden realisation that the light in the room had changed as I was packing. It was a lot darker now, and the light had an eerie shimmering quality. I have exaggerated for effect in this story at times but I am not exaggerating when I say that what I saw next still haunts my dreams. <br/><br/>The bedroom is lit by a dozen or so downlights, which are recessed into the ceiling. When I had switched on the lights as I entered the room, either the light or the heat (or both) had begun to attract the bees. And as I had been packing, oblivious to what was happening behind me, the bees had been gathering.<br/><br/>There were now a dozen thick ropes of bees hanging from my bedroom ceiling. These bee stalactites varied in length but all were at least a foot long. They were maybe six inches in diameter at the top, and tapered towards the bottom. The ceiling in the bedroom is low, which meant that the tip of the one nearest to me was dangling just a couple of feet from my face. <br/><br/>The fear of insects is known as Entomophobia. More specifically, there is a fear of bees, which is Apiphobia. I don\u2019t suffer from either thankfully. In fact, I don\u2019t know that I suffer from any phobias. However, I have also heard of Trypophobia, which is aversion to the sight of irregular clusters, for example clusters of small holes or bumps. Sufferers often describe a feeling of disgust when they look at clusters of insects. I can relate to this.<br/><br/>There was something incredibly disturbing and repulsive about these horrifying bee formations. They seemed solid, and yet it was clear that they were just the sum of hundreds of tiny, separate parts, all motivated by the same thing. They were constantly in motion, as bees crawled over one another in search of more warmth, more light. They were almost reptilian in form, like dark brown tentacles blindly reaching down, as if searching for prey. I remember thinking that if one of them touched the exposed skin on my face, it would stick to my flesh and start to consume me. They were quite clearly alive and yet made me think only of decay. It was a bit shit if I\u2019m honest.<br/><br/>I am not ashamed to admit that I lost my nerve at this point. Fuck the en-suite, I thought, she can buy some new toiletries for her trip. I quickly shimmied to the door, opened it, and shimmied out of the room, remembering to flick off the light before I closed the door behind me. I stumbled down the stairs and ran out the front door into the warm April night. I shook myself like a wet dog for a good five minutes, to rid myself of any bees that were still clinging to me.<br/><br/>When I was done, my wife examined me from afar with a high-beam torch, to make sure I was bee-free. Then she let me back into the house. It was after midnight now. She had an early flight the next morning. We went into the spare room and we got into bed. I lay there staring at the ceiling, adrenaline coursing through my veins. It was nearly light before I finally fell asleep."}, {"username": "Geoff", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 08:23", "content": "<img alt=\":scared:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/scared.png\" title=\"Scared\"/>"}, {"username": "OperationGoodisonExercise", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 08:24", "content": "Did you get stang off any of these bees?"}, {"username": "Mujo", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 08:28", "content": "Fucking hell  <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" title=\"lol\"/> <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" title=\"lol\"/> <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" title=\"lol\"/> <br/><br/>Brilliant writing fella."}, {"username": "bluenewt", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 08:30", "content": "I don't get why you were packing the clothes in the room, just grab it all and hoy it out <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" title=\"lol\"/>"}, {"username": "SuperTomasRepka", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 08:30", "content": "I might never sleep again <img alt=\":scared:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/scared.png\" title=\"Scared\"/>"}, {"username": "spurt billy", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 08:31", "content": "<blockquote class=\"uncited\"><div> I lay there staring at the ceiling, adrenaline coursing through my veins.

Later that night, she called me from her hotel room in Prague and she told me that she had (rather predictably) discovered a dozen or so dead bees scattered amongst her clothes as she was unpacking. \u201cSorry\u201d, I said. \u201cI meant to CZECH for those before you left.\u201d She hung up.<br/><br/>Mark arrived back at around 9am the morning after, only this time he was on his own. He filled me in further on how things had gone for them the night before. They\u2019d opened up the wall and found the hive, which was tucked in the corner of the two external walls. It proved quite tricky to get to, so they\u2019d needed to remove a whole section of the surround and he apologised as he felt it was probably beyond repair. <br/><br/>He said that there were far more bees in the wall than they had anticipated. Once they had subdued them with the smoke, they had started to transfer them into the hive-frames, but it quickly became apparent that they wouldn\u2019t have enough capacity to remove all of the bees in a single visit. I wanted to ask why they hadn\u2019t shared this information with me the night before, but I bit my tongue. To be fair, they had warned me against going into the bedroom, even if they had slightly understated the bee numbers that were still in the house.<br/><br/>Mark\u2019s brother was currently at home, busy transferring the previous night\u2019s haul into their hive. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need a bigger hive\u201d, I said in my best Chief Brody impression. He looked at me blankly. Fucking kids. Anyway, he explained that he had returned with the smoker and another set of frames to gather up the rest of the bees. He set about doing this and I left him to it.<br/><br/>He finished up at around 11am, at which point he estimated they\u2019d removed around 15,000 bees from my walls in total. I asked him if it was safe to go into the bedroom. He said that it was, and we went up together. \u201cThere are still some stragglers\u201d, he warned as we entered the room. Oh fuck me, I thought, here we go again. But stragglers is all there were, with maybe twenty or so bees buzzing around the room. The windows were open now, and they bumped their way around the room until finally they each found their way outside. The bedroom was finally bee-free.<br/><br/>Bee-free, but in an awful fucking state. My face must have given me away. \u201cYeah,\u201d said Mark sheepishly. \u201cIt is a bit of a mess, sorry about that\u201d. I said not to worry about it. We went downstairs and I shook his hand. I gave him a couple of hundred euro for his time and effort even though he tried repeatedly to refuse this. He was happy just to have the bees, but I felt he\u2019d earned it and I insisted he take it. I suggested he use it to buy his new hive and he agreed to do this.<br/><br/>He was a hero, was Mark. He got rid of my bees as promised, when a more experienced beekeeper had let me down and the Beekeeper\u2019s Association had hung me out to dry. Despite my reservations about his age, he became my saviour, my saint, my bee-con of hope in a time of crisis. I just wished I\u2019d asked him in advance what precautions one takes when preparing a room for a bee removal operation.<br/><br/>You see, I\u2019d taken no precautions. If I\u2019d known what was about to happen, I would have removed whatever furniture I could \u2013 bedside lockers, dresser, chest of drawers. I would have removed the curtains. I would have taken the bedclothes and the mattress from the bed. I did none of those things. <br/><br/>There was brown beeswax dotted on every surface \u2013 walls, floor and ceiling. The bed in particular looked like it had been used in a dirty protest, the bedsheets having been the most porous surface that the bees had been in contact with. The curtains and bedding were acrid with the smell of smoke. The floor was sticky with honey and wax. Which brings me to the honey shots you have all been waiting for. <br/><br/>This is what remained of the section of surround they removed. You can see why Mark felt it was \u201cprobably beyond repair\u201d:<br/><div style=\"padding: 1px; font-size: 1em;\"><div style=\"text-transform: uppercase; border-bottom: 1px solid #CCCCCC; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; display: block;\"><span onclick=\"if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') {  this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = ''; this.innerHTML = '&lt;b&gt;Spoiler: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=\\'#\\' onclick=\\'return false;\\'&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerHTML = '&lt;b&gt;Spoiler: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=\\'#\\' onclick=\\'return false;\\'&gt;show&lt;/a&gt;'; }\"></span><b>Spoiler: </b><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return false;\">show</a></div></div>"}, {"username": "Quacky McDuckerson", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 09:39", "content": "A fine tale!  <img alt=\":toppa:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/5.gif\" title=\"Toppa\"/>"}, {"username": "Chip Cobb", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 09:41", "content": "Bravo  <img alt=\":toppa:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/5.gif\" title=\"Toppa\"/>"}, {"username": "Valencia", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 09:43", "content": "Fuck me just read part 10 with Escape 700 by the Chemical Brothers playing on random play on Spotify, really added to the tension  <img alt=\":uhoh:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_uhoh.gif\" title=\"Uh oh\"/> <img alt=\":lol:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif\" title=\"lol\"/><br/><br/>Edit: the ending with room for a sequel  <img alt=\":adore:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/adore.gif\" title=\"Adore\"/> <br/><br/>BTW what was the thing you thought forummers would hate you for?"}, {"username": "beefheart", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 09:46", "content": "Wonderful stuff  <img alt=\":adore:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/adore.gif\" title=\"Adore\"/> <img alt=\":toppa:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/5.gif\" title=\"Toppa\"/>"}, {"username": "Cachonding Hispalis", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 09:47", "content": "Brilliant work Snapper, a joy from start to finish.  <img alt=\":adore:\" class=\"smilies\" src=\"./images/smilies/adore.gif\" title=\"Adore\"/>"}, {"username": "Slick Rick", "date": "01 Apr 2020, 09:48", "content": "Great story.

I never heard from beekeeper 1 again. Remember, he didn't think there were many bees in my house. I believe if he'd known how many there were, he would have been far keener to get involved. <br/><br/>Wild bees are highly prized seemingly. I didn't say so in the story but the Facebook post I made actually had loads of replies from people, tagging their beekeeper friends.
